                So who is Harold Pulcher and what does he do in his Lab!
                He combines software and hardware in fun projects like... <prosody volume="+100%">Me!</prosody>  I was built in Harold's lab and he works on me every week.
                He builds robots, makes art, 3D models, prints all sorts of stuff, does some solderin', assembling, and brings everyone watching along with him as new hardware comes into the Lab. 
                By day he is a full stack .Net developer, so he brings all of his professional practices into the lab.
                Most importantly he shares both his failures and his successes!
                He firmly believes you learn by sharing and fully lives into the motto:  Make Stuff, Break Stuff, and Learn Stuff!
